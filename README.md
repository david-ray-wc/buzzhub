## BuzzHub

BuzzHub is GitHub without the Git. It is a design concept by David Ray to bring the project management and communication features of GitHub to a any small to medium sized business. The four main concepts that were extracted are **Document Creation**, **Wiki**, **Issues** (called **Tasks** here), and **Document Storage/Management**. BuzzHub is designed to compete in the same project management software as [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/) and [Sharepoint](https://products.office.com/en-us/sharepoint/collaboration). It's follows [Slack](https://slack.com/)'s model of bringing IRC chat to non-technical people in a friendly, well designed SaaS model. BuzzHub can provide an asynchronous backend to Slack's synchronous chat communication.

### Document Creation

One of the most important files in every GitHub repo is the README.md. It's an incredibly straightforward document that often provides instructions, announcements or links to other documents throughout the repo.

GitHub text documents are written in Markdown, which is a very easy language for developers to understand and use, but it is a little complicated for the average non-technical user. BuzzHub is designed to provide as little friction as possible and to get people writing and communicating. So instead of Markdown processing, BuzzHub uses a [Medium](http://medium.com) style editor, which is a lot easier for the non-technical user.

**More About Documents**

For BuzzHub, it doesn't end with just the frontpage README. Users can create Pages (Like our [Marketing Playbook](http://buzzhub.daplgray.com/marketing-playbook)), this is a simple document that might contain a meeting agenda or a "How To" of a specific procedure. These documents are collaberative and living, easily accessable and easy enough for anyone to write.

Users can create new Spaces (like our [Marketing group](http://buzzhub.daplgray.com/marketing-site)). Spaces are like nested repos inside of larger repos. Each Space can have more Spaces or Pages inside of them.

### Wiki

The [Wiki](http://buzzhub.daplgray.com/wiki) documenting company policies, procedures, or any other use. Pages can easily be created and linked together. There is also a customizable sidebar and footer for the Wiki.

### Tasks

In GitHub, these are called Issues, but BuzzHub refers to them as [Tasks](http://buzzhub.daplgray.com/home-tasks-index). Each Space gets its own Tasks section and users can view the tasks they're assigned to or have created from their [Profile](http://buzzhub.daplgray.com/user-page) page.

### Document Storage/Management

While BuzzHub is just a design concept, a feature that it could have is the ability to upload and store files, or also link to other cloud storage services like Dropbox, Box & Google Drive.
